So I guess I should introduce myself. I'm known as CrimsonTome online (not that I'm well known at all), but if you do speak to me then feel free to call me Matt.  
I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Hull.  
I studied Computer Science, Psychology and Sociology at York College.  
I have little experience with Linux unless you count tinkering with a Raspberry Pi which i have been doing for 5 years now. I have only recently (August 2021) switched from Windows 10 to Ubuntu on my laptop and am now somewhat familiar with Linux.  
Like many others, I enjoy playing video games in my spare time. My favourite franchises would have to be Fire Emblem and Borderlands. As a CS student I also enjoy coding primarily in Python and C# as these are what I am the most familiar with. However as part of working on this site I am learning some CSS and JS. I've always wanted to learn C/C++ but never really had the time for it. 
If for some reason you need to contact me then my Discord is: CrimsonTome427#7459
Or send me an email at <crimsontome427@protonmail.com>
