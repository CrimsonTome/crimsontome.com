This post will act as an informal introduction to Freeside

## What is Freeside?

Freeside is the student run Linux user group at the University of Hull.

## How do I join?

Unlike many groups at a university, there is **no** membership cost to become a member of Freeside. It is also irrelevant which course you are taking, everyone is welcome here - even if you don't attend the university! You can join the Freeside Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/jE5VGjCu).

## What do we do?

Linux, seems a bit of a vague description doesn't it? How about I go into a little more detail.
Freeside provides an environment for everyone to learn more about Linux, open-source development, system administration, have experience with networking and career opportunities, social events / weekly virtual meet ups and access to the Freeside lab (Freeside Lab available to UoH students only).
