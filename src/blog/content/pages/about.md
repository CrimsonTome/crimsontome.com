So I guess I should introduce myself I'm Robyn(She/Her), a DevOps Engineer from the UK. I studied computer science at the University of Hull. I was the Webmaster for [HullCSS](https://hullcss.org) during my second year and was a member of the sysadmin team at [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk) for two years.
I studied Computer Science, Psychology and Sociology at College.  
I have been working with Linux since since 2016, starting doing hardware projects on a Raspberry Pi and use it as part of my day to day life in DevOps. I code primarily in Bash/Shell and C# as these are what I am the most familiar with. I also know some C++ and Python. You can see what I like to use at my [stack page](https://crimsontome.com/stack/).
