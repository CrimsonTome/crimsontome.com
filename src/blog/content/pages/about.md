So I guess I should introduce myself. I'm known as CrimsonTome online (not that I'm well known at all), but if you do speak to me then feel free to call me Robyn.
I am second year Computer Science student at the University of Hull, at which I am the Webmaster for [HullCSS](https://hullcss.org) and a member of the sysadmin team at [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk)
I studied Computer Science, Psychology and Sociology at York College and achieved grades C, C and A respectively.
I have some experience with Linux, which started with tinkering with a Raspberry Pi which i have been doing for 5 years now. In August 2021 I switched from Windows 10 to Ubuntu --> Kubuntu --> Arch --> MX --> Fedora KDE (current) on my laptop (though it has died recently, rip laptop) and now use Debian 12 on my PC.
Like many others, I enjoy playing video games in my spare time. My favourite franchises would have to be Fire Emblem and Borderlands, though have recently been sinking my teeth into Slay the Spite. As a CS student I also enjoy coding primarily in Bash/Shell and C# as these are what I am the most familiar with. I also know some C++ from uni and spent a lot of time writing Python projects when I did Raspi projects. I love working on Linux sysadmin and spend a lot of time working on my VPS and tinkering with Docker.
