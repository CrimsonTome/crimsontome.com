So I guess I should introduce myself I'm Robyn, a DevOps Engineer at [VISR Dynamics](https://visr-vr.com). 
I'm not technically a student at the University of Hull anymore. I was the Webmaster for [HullCSS](https://hullcss.org) during my second year and am still a member of the sysadmin team at [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk).
I studied Computer Science, Psychology and Sociology at College.  
I have been working with Linux in at least some capacity for the last 6 years, and it now forms a large part of my job in DevOps. I code primarily in Bash/Shell and C# as these are what I am the most familiar with. I also know some C++ and Python. You can see what I like to use at my [stack page](https://crimsontome.com/stack/)
