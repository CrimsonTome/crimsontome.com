Back in July, I wrote a post detailing [what I run on my VPS](https://crimsontome.com/posts/my-current-vps-setup), some things have changed since then so I thought I'd come back with an update. If you haven't read the previous post I suggest you do. 

Firstly, I switched VPS providers from Digital Ocean to [OVH](ovhcloud.com/). This was for a few reasons, the prices for droplets at DO were going up, meaning my free credits from the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) would not last me as long as I first thought. In addition to this, at around the time the price increase was announced OVH was having a summer sale, dramatically decreaseing the prices of some of their tiers. The VPS I run now is (on paper) twice as fast as the DO droplet I was using. With a dual core CPU and 4GB of RAM, compared to a single core with 2GB of RAM. The OVH VPS also comes with a larger 50GB SSD. In theory these specs are more than good enough for what I am plan to run and what I currently use it for.
