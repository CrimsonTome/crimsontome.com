Please note that I will be updating this as I go along. This is my **first** time using Netlify, as such I lack a lot of experience using the service so far. I have been using GitHub consistently since September 2021 so I am still relatively new to how everything works. 

## Still here?

Well, let's begin.

First of all, if you want to use GitHub as the source for your code you'll need a repository(repo). If you're reading this then you may be new to GitHub like I was not so long ago.  

### Creating the repo

- Go to <https://github.com/new>
- Under ``Repository name`` enter what you want the repo to be called e.g. my-blog
- Under ``Description `` you can add a bit about your site, for example what it is about and how it is made
- Make sure ``Public`` is ticked, it should be by default
- You can tick ``Add a README file `` to go into more detail about your code if you wish. It is not completely necessary but may be useful for explaining your repo to other users or those that are interested but don't understand what exactly is going on by viewing the code itself
